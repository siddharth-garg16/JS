//do something from all the shapes like circle, rectangle, triangle
export {circle} from "./shapes/circle.js";
export {rectangle} from "./shapes/rectangle.js";
export {triangle} from "./shapes/triangle.js";

// we do export here too because import only allows to use things themselves but doesn't allow to transfer it to other files
